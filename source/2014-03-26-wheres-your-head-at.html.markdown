Week 4

Week 4 of gSchool finds the heroes and heroines of the drama that has become our lives entrenched in the early
stages of web app development. The foe this week is none other than Old Blue Eyes himself, Sinatra. Sinatra is
a lightweight framework for building web applications that (from what I am told) is very flexible, but requires
a little more understanding than Rails.

Many of us quickly find that our knowledge of hashes is less solid than previously thought. For two full days,
we struggle through the implementation of a simple (semi-dynamic) web page. Epic is not quite the word, but also
not too far off.  Seems that most of us don’t know this diddy…

Some students excel, some fall behind, some, already exhausted by the grueling pace, fall victim to illness.
It is difficult not to start asking questions regarding the teaching methods that are being used, but an early
week visit from former gSchool students presents us with an interesting thought: Your life as a developer will
be like this all the time.  Yes, it is great to be proficient at a particular language, or have an eye for css
and html design, but if you aren’t able to think on your feet, understand how to work through problems and adapt
to your environment….well, let’s just say that your going to flop on stage.

For now, we get to flop in front of our encouraging brethren and sistren, but you get the feeling that the real
world won’t be so forgiving.
