It git-speak, a detached head state is normally a negative term.  It means to be out of line, away from the master.
You have intentionally moved your head pointer away from the most recent commits.  Gone off the reservation. Worst of all,
git's biggest gift (the recordation of history) becomes your paparazzi by cataloging your every move.

Although making commits in a detached head state usually leads to extra work (and embarrassment), there might be something
to the whole idea...

I started Galvanize's gSchool at the age of 32, leaving a career as an Attorney to pursue the dream of becoming a developer.
You could say that I deviated from the master plan a little. Life, in general, becomes a little more comfortable as you get older.
You start to come to terms with your strengths, your weaknesses, your personality, _other_ people's personalities. In fact,
that is one of the best things about getting older; life seems a little less dramatic.

In  Zen Buddhism, the concept of “Shoshin” means to have a “beginner’s mind.” It means to be open, eager and lacking in preconceptions.
Many people practice this because they find they have become too mired in their own preconceived notions and experience to see possibilities.
I have to admit that switching careers mid-stream has caused me a little more appreciation of this idea.  Nothing brings about the
understanding of Shoshin quite like actually being a beginner. You get the idea…

Over the next sixth months, check back in on this blog for some thoughts on detached head states, beginners’ minds, branches that may become
masters and the development of a developer.
