One of the things that continues to surprise me about learning to become a developer is the fact
that nothing is as it seemed at the beginning.  Even when you start to grasp (grok?) concepts that
you thought you had a handle on at a deeper level, you realize what an idiot you were at the beginning
of the process.  I could write a post about each one one these things, but there is one in particular
that has been on my mind recently: emotions.

Didn’t expect that?  I didn’t either.  It did not occur to me before starting a developer bootcamp that
my emotional competency would even be a part of the scenario. Further, I certainly would not have thought
that my emotions would be challenged any more than they were in previous educational contexts (i.e. graduate
school, taking the bar exam).

Looking back now, I realize that it should not have been a surprise. Working with computers in the past has
never been as simple as I’d hoped.  As with most things, though, you realize that the errors are usually yours.
The computer simply reflects what you tell it to do. However, the most difficult emotional aspect of development
is not the frustration caused by solving complex problems with a computer, it’s dealing with people.

As developers, especially as developers who practice pair programming, you have to deal with other people far more
than I would have initially thought.  You have to deal with project owners, users, pairing-partners, other teams,
designers, bosses and any others I have not mentioned (or know exist). Every job I have had has always involved
relationships with other team members, bosses and clients, but as an add-on, in software development (at least the
type that we are learning) you have another human being at your side witnessing your every keystroke. It’s almost
like that person gets to watch the outpouring of thoughts as you translate them into code.  It is an extremely
vulnerable moment.  You find yourself apologizing far more than you ever have in your life, feeling embarrassed
about not knowing things that (in all reality) you had no reason to know prior to that moment.  You become extremely
aware of your weaknesses. All of this on top of the mental gymnastics you are performing to actually solve the problem
at hand in the code. Sprinkle in some story changes, unclear or contradicting expectations, mercurial bosses or project
owners and you have the makings of a afternoon soap opera. In your head and in reality.

I would venture a guess that most people outside of software development would not expect software developers to be very
advanced in the realm of interpersonal skills and emotions, but I am starting to understand that this stereotype may be
slightly misguided. Developers deal with interpersonal relationships in the context of real work better than most
professionals I have met, including doctors, lawyers and skilled tradesmen.  In each of those professions, there is a
clear distinction between the expert and the client. When two professionals in those fields work together, it is usually
as an amalgamation of individual efforts and building upon each others work.  I have yet to come across two carpenters
sharing one hammer to drive in one nail or two painters with one brush painting a room.

Going into my 8th week in gSchool, I am beginning to see that the lessons I am going to learn will go far beyond technical
coding skills and into the realm of life-lessons; Ones that may make me a better employee, coworker, developer and,
possibly, human being.
